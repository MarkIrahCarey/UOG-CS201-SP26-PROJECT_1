## Project 1: Creating simple yet powerful projects

Project 1 is about combining every part of Chapters 1 - 3 to create a small but powerful program.

You have **complete freedom** to program what you want! 

**The only requirements**: Your program must meaningfully use most of the concepts from each chapter.

The chapters are the following:

**Chapter 1**:
- Getting information from the user
- Convert strings to numbers when needed

**Chapter 2**:
- Create and use variables with appropriate data types
- Perform calculations using the operations
- The `math` module

**Chapter 3**:
- Use of if/elif/else statements to create decisions
- The use of for loops, while loops, and the break statement
- Shortcut operations
- The `random` module

This means you **cannot** use anything beyond these 3 chapters (i.e. other modules/libraries, creating custom functions, etc.)

**The only exception** is lists/arrays as we have used this a little bit on Chapter 3. But, **JUST** lists. 

This means that the program has to be simple enough to allow for all 3 chapters, but not so simple that you can't cover every concept.

Note: Your project must have the following header, you may copy and paste:

```
"""
Author: Your Name
Date: Today's Date/Due Date
FileName: The File's Name
Purpose: What the program is about
"""
```

## Grading Rubric

| Criteria | Chapter | Adequate | Good | Excellent |
|:---------|:-------:|:---------|:-----|:----------|
| **User input** | 1 | Attempts to get input from user, but may have issues (0-3 pts) | Program successfully gets a users input (4-7 pts) | Program gets user input and meaningfully uses it in program (8 pts) |
| **Conversion** | 1, 2 | Attempts to convert data types but errors occur (0-3 pts) | Successfully converts data types (4-7 pts) | Converts input correctly and handles **invalid** input gracefully (8 pts) |
| **Variables & Data Types** | 1, 2 | Variables are used but may be inconsistently named (0-3 pts) | Variables are properly named with appropriate types (4-7 pts) | Variables are well-named, appropriately typed, and used efficiently (8 pts) |
| **Operations** | 2, 3 | Made use of no or little operation (0-3 pts) | Uses some simple operations (4-7 pts) | Uses a combination of operations in creative or meaningful ways (8 pts) |
| **Math or Random Module** | 2, 3 | No use of math or random module (0pts) | Uses math or random module (1-3 pts) | Creatively uses the math or random module in many different ways (4 pts) |
| **Selection Statements** | 3 | Makes use of some one way, two way statements (0-3 pts) | Uses multiple if/elif/else statements (4-7 pts) | Uses selection statements effectively with clear, logical conditions (8 pts) |
| **Loops** | 3 | Attempts to use loops but may have logic issues (0-3 pts) | Uses for loops or while loops that works (4-7 pts) | Uses loops efficiently and appropriately for the task (8 pts) |
| **Loop Control** | 3 | Little to no loop control was used (0-3 pts) | Loop has clear condition and terminates properly (4-7 pts) | Loop is well-structured with proper exit condition; bonus if break is used appropriately (8 pts) |
| **Runs without errors** | Functionality | Program runs but has to be modified for some errors (0-3 pts) | Program runs with minimal errors, errors are small (4-9 pts) | Program runs without no errors (10 pts) |
| **Logic Errors** | Functionality | Program doesn't run as intended (0-3 pts) | Program runs but some areas need tweaks for proper functionality (4-9 pts) | Program runs as intended (10 pts) |
| **User experience** | Functionality | Program leaves user confused when using it (0-3 pts) | Program gives instructions but may leave the user a little confused or lost (4-9 pts) | Program gives clear and well formatted instructions (10 pts) |
| **Documetation** | Documentation | Code has little to no comments describing code (0-3pts)| Code has some comments, may have some areas that need more explaining (4-9pts)| Code is well documented (10pts)
Total | | | | 100pts|

### Here are some ideas to get you started!

- **Choose Your Own Adventure** - Text-based story where you guide the user through an adventure
- **Escape Room** Text-based story where you throw the user into a room they have to escape 
- **Simple Calculator** - Let user choose operations, repeat until they quit
- **Calendar Project** - User enters a the year, month, and day, returns that months calendar
- **Math Quiz** - Generate random math problems, track their score and also have them choose the difficulty

These are suggestions. Remember that you can create your own idea!
